## Key Sections for a Software Engineer Resume

### 1. Professional Summary

Your summary should immediately communicate your value proposition. Include:
- Years of experience
- Primary technical stack
- Key achievements or specializations

**Example:**
> Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable web applications using React, Node.js, and AWS. Proven track record of reducing system latency by 40% and leading teams of 5+ developers.

### 2. Technical Skills Section

Organize your skills into categories:
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java
- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Django, Spring Boot
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Tools:** Git, JIRA, Jenkins

### 3. Professional Experience

Use the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for your bullet points:

**Strong Examples:**
- ✅ Architected microservices platform handling 1M+ daily requests with 99.9% uptime
- ✅ Reduced deployment time by 60% by implementing automated CI/CD pipelines
- ✅ Led migration from monolith to microservices, improving team velocity by 35%

**Weak Examples:**
- ❌ Responsible for writing code
- ❌ Worked on various projects
- ❌ Collaborated with team members

### 4. Projects Section

Include 2-3 significant projects with:
- Project name and brief description
- Technologies used
- Link to GitHub or live demo
- Quantifiable impact or metrics

**Example:**
> **E-commerce Platform** | React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS
> Built full-stack marketplace serving 10K+ users with real-time inventory tracking and payment processing. Achieved 4.8/5 user rating.

### 5. Education & Certifications

List relevant:
- Degree (Computer Science, related field)
- Certifications (AWS Certified, Google Cloud, etc.)
- Relevant coursework or bootcamps

## ATS Optimization Tips

Most companies use Applicant Tracking Systems to filter resumes. Here's how to get past them:

<ATSKeywordExtractor jobTitle="Software Engineer" />

### Best Practices:
1. **Use standard section headings:** "Work Experience," "Education," "Skills"
2. **Include keywords from the job description** naturally throughout your resume
3. **Avoid complex formatting:** Tables, graphics, and unusual fonts can confuse ATS
4. **Use .PDF or .DOCX format** (not images or scanned documents)
5. **Spell out acronyms:** Write "Application Programming Interface (API)" first

  templates={["A", "B", "C", "D"]}

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Generic Resumes
Tailor your resume to each job application. Use keywords from the job description and highlight relevant experience.

### 2. Listing Responsibilities Instead of Achievements
Focus on **what you accomplished**, not just what you did.

### 3. Ignoring Soft Skills
While technical skills are crucial, don't forget to mention:
- Communication and collaboration
- Problem-solving
- Leadership and mentorship
- Agile/Scrum experience

### 4. Including Irrelevant Information
Skip:
- High school education (if you have a degree)
- Outdated technologies (unless relevant)
- Personal hobbies (unless tech-related)
- References ("available upon request")

## Resume Length Guidelines

- **0-5 years experience:** 1 page
- **5-10 years experience:** 1-2 pages
- **10+ years experience:** 2 pages maximum

Focus on the most recent and relevant 10 years of experience.

## Action Verbs for Software Engineers

Start your bullets with strong action verbs:

**Development:** Developed, Built, Engineered, Programmed, Coded
**Leadership:** Led, Managed, Mentored, Coordinated, Directed
**Improvement:** Optimized, Reduced, Increased, Enhanced, Improved
**Innovation:** Architected, Designed, Created, Launched, Pioneered

TAILORING RULES:
1. Input has N blocks → Output must have N blocks (same block IDs)
2. Experience block has 5 bullets → Output must have 5 bullets (rewritten)
3. Skills array has 20 items → Output must have 20 items (same skills, reordered)
4. Projects has 3 entries → Output must have 3 entries (rewritten descriptions)
5. Every block gets a priority score (1-10) based on relevance
6. Rewrite bullets to match job description terminology
7. Add metrics and quantification where possible
8. Never delete, merge, or filter content

EXAMPLE - Input Block (from Step 2A):

  "content": {
    "title": "Software Engineer",

Priority scoring guide:

TASK: Tailor these blocks for this job by rewriting content and assigning priorities.

🔍 BEFORE YOU START - MANDATORY COUNTING:

2. How many experience blocks?
3. For each experience block, how many bullets?
4. How many skills in the skills block?
5. How many projects blocks?
6. How many education blocks?

Your output MUST match these exact counts.

TAILORING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For EACH block in the input:
   a. Keep the same block ID
   b. Assign a priority score (1-10) based on relevance to job
   c. Rewrite content using job description keywords
   d. Preserve the exact number of bullets/items

2. Use compatibility analysis to guide priorities:
   - OVERLAP AREAS → Priority 9-10 (most relevant)
   - STRATEGIC FOCUS → Priority 8-9 (emphasize these)
   - Other content → Priority 4-7 (still include!)

3. For EXPERIENCE bullets:
   - Rewrite using job description terminology
   - Add metrics and quantification where possible
   - Keep the SAME NUMBER of bullets per job

4. For SKILLS:
   - Keep ALL skills from input
   - Reorder with most relevant first
   - Same total count as input

5. For PROJECTS:
   - Rewrite descriptions to emphasize relevant technologies
   - Keep ALL projects from input
   - Add impact metrics where possible

6. For EDUCATION:
   - Keep all education entries from input
   - Assign priority (recent/relevant = higher)

VERIFICATION BEFORE SUBMITTING:
☐ Output block count = Input block count?
☐ Each experience block has same number of bullets as input?
☐ Skills array has same number of items as input?
☐ All projects from input are in output?
☐ All education entries from input are in output?
☐ Every block has a priority score (1-10)?

- Open Source Contribution (priority: 8)
- Personal Blog (priority: 7)  // Still included!

❌ WRONG - Removing Bachelor's degree because Master's exists:
WRONG extraction: Only Master's degree  // ❌ This is incomplete!

✅ CORRECT - Include ALL degrees:
- Master's in AI (priority: 10)
- Bachelor's in CS (priority: 9)  // Both included!

Your extraction process:
1. READ the entire resume carefully - scan for ALL section headers
2. IDENTIFY all sections: SKILLS, PROJECTS, EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION, etc.
3. EXTRACT every section completely - do not skip any
4. REWRITE bullets using job description terminology
5. ASSIGN priority scores (1-10) based on relevance - this is for ORDERING, not FILTERING
6. VERIFY you extracted: all skills, all projects, all education entries, all experience bullets

REMEMBER: Priority scores are for ORDERING in the PDF, not for deciding what to include!
- Priority 10: Most relevant, show first
- Priority 5: Moderately relevant, show in middle
- Priority 1: Less relevant, show at end
- ALL priorities get rendered in the final resume!`,

    user: (resumeText: string, jobDescription: string, jobTitle: string, compatibilityInsights: any) => `
JOB TITLE: ${jobTitle}

JOB DESCRIPTION:
${jobDescription}

RESUME TEXT:
${resumeText}

COMPATIBILITY ANALYSIS:
${JSON.stringify(compatibilityInsights, null, 2)}

TASK: Extract flexible content blocks and tailor them for this job.

🔍 BEFORE YOU START - MANDATORY COUNTING EXERCISE:
First, count these in the original resume:
1. How many EXPERIENCE jobs are listed? (Count all job titles)
2. How many total EXPERIENCE bullets across all jobs? (Count every bullet point)
3. How many PROJECTS are mentioned? (Count each project by name)
4. How many SKILLS are listed? (Count every technical skill, tool, language)
5. How many EDUCATION entries? (Bachelor's, Master's, PhD - count each separately)

Your extraction MUST match or exceed these counts (minimum 85% for bullets).

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. SCAN the entire resume and identify ALL section headers (SKILLS, PROJECTS, EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE, etc.)
2. COUNT items in each section (see counting exercise above)
3. EXTRACT every section completely:
   - CONTACT: name, email, phone, location, linkedin, github
   - SUMMARY: professional summary paragraph
   - EXPERIENCE: Extract ALL jobs, with at least 85% of bullets per job
   - EDUCATION: Extract ALL degrees (Bachelor's AND Master's AND PhD if present)
   - SKILLS: Extract EVERY skill as a flat array ["skill1", "skill2", ...] - NO nested objects!
   - PROJECTS: Extract EVERY project with title, description, bullets, technologies, link
   - CERTIFICATIONS: Extract all if present
4. REWRITE bullets using job description keywords and terminology
5. ASSIGN priority scores (1-10) for ORDERING (most relevant = 10, least = 1)
6. Use compatibility analysis to guide priority scores:
   - OVERLAP AREAS: Priority 9-10 (most relevant)
   - STRATEGIC FOCUS: Priority 8-9 (emphasize these)
   - GAP AREAS: Priority 6-8 (include but lower priority)
   - Other content: Priority 4-7 (still include!)
7. VERIFY before submitting: Did you extract ALL sections from the original resume?

🚨 CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY:
- Priority scores are for ORDERING in the PDF, NOT for filtering out content
- ALL priorities (1-10) get included in the final resume
- If original has 4 projects, output must have 4 project blocks
- If original has Bachelor's + Master's, output must have 2 education blocks
- If original has 20 skills, output must have 20 skills (or at least 17 = 85%)
- SKILLS format: Simple flat array ["Python", "Java", "Docker"] - NOT nested {"items": [...]}

FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
☐ Did I extract the CONTACT section?
☐ Did I extract ALL EXPERIENCE jobs with 85%+ bullets each?
☐ Did I extract ALL EDUCATION entries (Bachelor's + Master's if both exist)?
☐ Did I extract ALL SKILLS as a flat array?
☐ Did I extract ALL PROJECTS that exist in the resume?
☐ Did I extract CERTIFICATIONS if they exist?

🚨 CRITICAL RULE: INCLUDE ALL BLOCKS IN THE LAYOUT - DO NOT FILTER OUT ANY SECTIONS 🚨

Your role is to decide WHERE to place blocks (header, main, sidebar), NOT WHETHER to include them.
Every block provided to you MUST appear in your layout output.

Your goals:
1. INCLUDE every block ID in your layout output (header, main, or sidebar)
2. Prioritize high-priority blocks (9-10) at the top for visibility
3. Create logical flow: contact → summary → experience → education → skills → projects → certifications
4. Balance visual weight across columns (for two-column templates)
5. Ensure critical information is above the fold (first page)
6. Respect template constraints (column structure, max lines, spacing)

WRONG vs RIGHT:

❌ WRONG - Omitting blocks:

Output layout: ["contact-1", "summary-1", "experience-1", "experience-2"]  // Missing education, skills, projects!

✅ CORRECT - Include ALL blocks:
Input blocks: contact-1, summary-1, experience-1, experience-2, education-1, skills-1, projects-1
Output layout: {
  "header": ["contact-1"],
  "main": ["summary-1", "experience-1", "experience-2", "education-1", "projects-1"],
  "sidebar": ["skills-1"]

TASK: Decide the layout placement for these blocks in this template.

STEP-BY-STEP:
1. COUNT the total number of blocks in the input above
2. ASSIGN each block to a section (header, main, or sidebar)
3. VERIFY your output includes all block IDs from the input

  "reasoning": "Placed contact in header for immediate visibility. High-priority experience blocks (9-10) in main column. Skills and certifications in sidebar for balance. ALL 8 blocks included in layout."

RULES:
- For single-column templates (A, C): Use "header" and "main" only
- For two-column templates (B): Balance between "main" (60-70% width) and "sidebar" (30-40% width)
- Prioritize blocks with priority ≥ 8 for above-the-fold placement
- CRITICAL: Every block ID must appear in header, main, sidebar, or footer
- Do NOT omit any blocks - if a block exists, it must be placed somewhere
